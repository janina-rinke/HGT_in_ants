# Selection analysis of selected LGTs using HyPhy and RELAX

Here, we will test for signatures of positive selection acting at different branches among the gene trees of LGTs.

Starting with the XGPRT-LGT in GAGA-0515, we will
1. Identify the 20 best BLAST hits in bacterial genomes
2. Retrieve and align the coding sequence of the bacterial XGPRT-genes 
3. Clean the alignments and compute a solid gene tree
4. Test the alignment for evidence of recombination
5. Test for evidence of positive selection
6. Identify branches that show significant signatures of positive selection

After that, we will test for selection in other ants with relevant LGTs.
